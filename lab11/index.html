    <p>
    Hi, I am <strong>Ashley Urban</strong>, I am an advertising major with a marketing minor. I am interested in researching brands and products and marketing them to the intended audience. I am a current member of the TNH advertising agency at Syracuse and have created several product briefs to pitch to potential clients. I enjoy making creative presentations with Photoshop, PremierePro, and Canva, and have skills in Microsoft excel. I am looking forward to expanding my skills and learning more at Syracuse every day. Outside of school and work, I love to boat, ski, and travel. I am from Annapolis, Maryland and have grown up on the water my whole life. I love to ski anywhere and everywhere, including with the SU ski team. I look forward to continuing to explore these passions in my career.
