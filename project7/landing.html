    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I am Ashley Urban, I am from Annapolis, Maryland and am a current sophomore at Syracuse University. I have a passion for fitness, food, and health. At home, I love to try new workout classes, visit fun smoothie bars, eat at local restaurants, and stay healthy with my friends. Unfortunately, at college time moves at rapid fire, the food options lack, and budgeting becomes difficult. Many college students struggle adjusting to college and quickly revert to unhealthy habits. I can say I definitely experienced that my first year at school. 
        I am excited to launch this site so that you all can follow along my journey discovering college eats!
         Freshman year, I first stepped foot in a college dining hall. It was overwhelming to say the least. As I glance around, I see a wall lined with every cereal flavor you can imagine, a display of 8 different pizza flavors in the center, and an entire case filled with pastries, bagels, and treats. The options seemed endless, but quickly I realized that staying healthy while eating here would be nearly impossible. I have discovered a new way to glance around the dining hall since, rather than grabbing that easy slice of pizza for dinner or bowl of fruit loops for breakfast, I have learned to create healthy meals with what I can find. In addition, I have found some delicious and healthy restaurants in the Syracuse area. I hope with the help of my site, I can inspire other college students to eat and live healthy, avoid the temptations, and discover “college eats.”
